# UGA_Capstone_Spring_25_GP_Red_Team

Welcome!

This is the Github for the Georgia Power Red Team for the University of Georgia's 2024-2025 Mechanical Engineering Capstone Team!

	You will find multiple folders in this repository:
 	1. Arduino Code - the home to all of the code that we have tested with and finalized.
  	2. CAD Files - As the entirety of this project is 3D Printed, we have all of the CAD Files from it stored here.
   	3. Showcase_Materials - Here are all powerpoints and posters that we used at the 2025 Engineering Capstone Showcase.


Our Project began with GA Power looking to utilize their drone fleet to help mitigate the power outages during storms and high winds caused by tree limbs and branches. The goal of this capstone project is to design, prototype, and test a device that can be incorporated within the UAV fleet of Georgia Power Company such that it can successfully remove a limb weighing up to 5 pounds and 3 inches in diameter.

Therefore, after months of ideation, we came up with the solution of a Tree Branch Grabbing Arm to attach to the drone. 

Via the use of Radio Frequency, this arm is to be attached to the bottom of the DJI M300 Drone and centered over the branch, done so by using the camera on board the drone.

Once the user has lined up the arm, they will utilize the handheld controller to close the arm. From there, the user may remove the branch from the powerline, allowing for a quicker restoration of power.
